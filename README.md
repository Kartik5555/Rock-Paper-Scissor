# Rock-Paper-Scissors
It's a small game in which we have to choose three of the following :-
1. Rock 🥌
2. Paper 📰
3. Scissors ✂️


and, after that computer also generate a random number from above.


### Lets taking an example
When player chooses the **Rock** and then at the same time computer 
   * Generates the same ( *Rock* ) then the game will be 
   
   
          - Tie :bowtie:


   * Generates Paper then
   
   
          - you will lose!


             - As **Paper** *covers* the **Rock** 


   * Generates **Scissors** then


          - you will win! 🏆


             - As **Rock** *Smashes* the **Scissors**
